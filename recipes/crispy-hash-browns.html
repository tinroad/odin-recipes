  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This recipe doesn't require much thought early in the morning, and tastes great!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, the drain and squeeze dry. Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the
      onion, flour, and eggs until evenly distributed</li>
    <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place
      potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like
      pancakes</li>
    <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5
      minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.</li>
    <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
